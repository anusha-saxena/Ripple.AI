Our app is designed to empower Indigenous communities and environmental advocates by simplifying treaty analysis, dispute resolution, and policy comparison.

Many Indigenous nations face challenges regarding land rights, water access, and policy enforcement, often due to complex legal frameworks and historical injustices. Treaties, which should safeguard Indigenous rights, are often difficult to interpret, compare, or enforce.

Our app provides an AI-driven solution to help communities identify similar treaties, analyze policy differences, and generate advocacy documents that support their claims and disputes through.
